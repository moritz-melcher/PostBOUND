    A random walk starts at any of the nodes of the graph. At each iteration, a neighboring node is selected and moved to.
    Afterwards, the iteration continues with that node.

    Our implementation uses the following modifications: after each stop, the walk may jump to a node that is connected to
    one of the visited nodes. This node does not necessarily have to be connected to the current node. Secondly, if the
    graph contains multiple connected components, the walk will first explore one component before jumping to the next
    one.

    The walk finishes when all nodes have been explored.

    """A graph walk models a traversal of some graph.

    Each walk begins at a specific *start node* and then follows a *path* along other nodes and edges.

    Notice that depending on the specific use-case the path might deviate from a normal walk. More specifically, two
    special cases might occur:

    1. the edge data can be ``None``. This indicates that the walk jumped to a different node without using an edge. For
       example, this might happen if the walk moved to a different connected component of the graph.
    2. the next node in the walk might not be connected to the current node in the path, but to some node that has
       already been visited instead. This is especially the case for so-called *frontier walks* which can be computed
       using the `nx_frontier_walks` method.

    The walk can be iterated over by its nodes and nodes can be checked for containment in the walk. Length calculation is
    also supported.

    A *frontier walk* is a generalized version of a normal walk over a graph: Whereas a normal walk traverses the edges in the
    graph to move from node to node in a local fashion (i.e. only based on the edges of the current node), a frontier walk
    remembers all the nodes that have already been visited. This is called the *frontier* of the current walk. To find the next
    node, any edge from any of the nodes in the frontier can be selected.

    Notice that the frontier walk also remembers nodes that have already been visited and prevents them from being visited
    again.

    Our implementation augments this procedure by also allowing jumps to other partitions in the graph. This will happen if all
    nodes in the current connected component have been visited, but more unexplored nodes remain.

    Notice that this method already distinguishes between paths if they differ in the traversed edges, even if the sequence of

        b - c


    The frontier walks produced by this function will include the sequence *a* -> *b* -> *c* twice (among many other
