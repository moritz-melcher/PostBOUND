"""Contains utilities to conveniently execute individual queries or entire workloads and to evaluate their results.

This module provides direct access to some frequently-used functionality, mostly related to workload modelling and execution.
Other modules need to be imported explicitly.

Specifically, this package provides the following modules:

- `analysis` provides a loose collection of utilities and formulas somewhat related to query optimization
- `ceb` provides an implementation of the Cardinality Estimation Benchmark workload generator
- `executor` contains utilities to benchmark individual queries or entire workloads
- `interactive` contains a simple interactive join order optimizer
- `workloads` provides an abstraction for workloads (collections of queries for benchmarking) along with tools to read them
