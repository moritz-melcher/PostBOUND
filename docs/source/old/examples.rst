Optimization scenarios and examples
===================================

The ``examples`` directory of the source code contains a number of scripts that showcase many features of PostBOUND. These can
be started from the ``postbound`` directory using ``python3 -m examples.<example name>``, e.g.
``python3 -m examples.example-01-basic-workflow``

The ``experiments`` directory also contains some ready to run scripts that can serve as more advanced examples (although they
are not particularly well documented).
